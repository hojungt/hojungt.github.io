                        In March 2020, New York City was hit hard at the peak of COVID-19.
                        While the City responded with immediate relief effort, this pandemic also forced the City to make significant budget cuts across its public services to maintain emergency service.
                        During this time, food distribution chains were disrupted, and all composting options were suspended.
                        Local farmers were struggling to distribute their produce, and residents around New York City were unable to compost household waste. On May 4th, also known as International Compost Awareness Day, New York City officially stopped collecting compost. On June 30th, the City finalized its 2021 Executive Budget, cutting last year’s $28 million allowance for composting down to only $2.86 million. This eliminates both the citywide residential brown bin collection and compost drop-offs at Greenmarkets.
